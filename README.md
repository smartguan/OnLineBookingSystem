Rancho Rinconada Parks and Recreation
Online booking system

We would be interested in an online platform/system that would be useful for the following:
Front end:
- Enabling users to see available timeslots/days on a simple calendar.
- Enabling users to “reserve” specified days/times either recurring or one time, based on their preferences.
- Notify users by email of their just-scheduled appointments.
- Ability to view calendars in the future or in the past (typically +/-5 months)	
Back end:
- Possibility of integrating the system to checkout with an online payment system
- Ability to (dis)approve of users reservation, with a notification email being sent out.
- Ability to create additional fields and labels as needed.	
- 	For example, during month A we may require only the name, contact 	information to be provided upon reservation whereas during month B 	we may require additional data like preferences, payment type, etc…
- An export function to Excel (preferably), or a database like mysql.
- A simple organization system/ability to query for info (e.g. how many reservations during the month of july?)
- Ability to create radio buttons (pick the following time frames), text fields (which hours work for you), drop down (select from the following available reservable times)

The application will ideally be run alongside WordPress. Any web-friendly programming language (Java, RoR, etc…) will be adequate
